# Roulette Game - "Cover the Table" (aka "Cover All Bases") extraction method
Play the classic European roulette written in Java by using the "Cover The Table" (also known as "Cover All Bases") extraction method.

The method analyzed in this application is known as "Cover the Table" or "Cover All Bases". This system involves covering almost all the numbers on the roulette table, leaving only very few numbers uncovered, such as two. The goal is to maximize the odds of winning on each spin of the wheel, although the profit for each win is generally low compared to the total bet. The app proves that the dealer always wins and that he does it very early too. Even the "Cover the table" method is therefore very risky for the player.

Example of a series (example of the content of the file "serie.txt" that must be in the same folder where the executable JAR resides): {
